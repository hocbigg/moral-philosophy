## How to use this curriculum

### Core Sections

Study them **in this exact order** to develop a clear and coherent understanding of ethics:

1. **I. Philosophical Orientation and Tools**  
   Start here. This section teaches you how to think philosophically and how to read, analyze, and evaluate arguments — skills you will use in every later section.

2. **II. Historical Foundations of Ethical Thought**  
   Next, work through the historical development of major ethical ideas. This gives you the big picture of how moral philosophy has evolved over time.

3. **IV. Core Ethical Theories (Normative Ethics)**  
   This is the heart of the subject. Here you learn the three major families of ethical theories that almost every contemporary ethical discussion still relies on.

4. **V. Metaethics**  
   Finish the core by studying metaethics. This section helps you understand what moral claims actually mean and whether they can be objectively true — the deepest “why” questions behind the theories you just learned.

### Specialization Tracks

The remaining sections (III, VI, VII, VIII, IX) are optional extensions. They become much easier and more meaningful after you have finished the Core.

You can pick and choose among them based on what interests you most:

- **III. Foundations Supporting Ethics**: Choose this if you want to understand the deeper philosophical questions about knowledge, free will, and responsibility that lie underneath ethics.
- **VI. Moral Psychology and Agency**: Pick this if you are curious about the human side: why people actually behave morally (or don’t), emotions, character, and blame.
- **VII. Applied Ethics**: Go here if you want to see how ethical theories apply to concrete real-world issues (medicine, environment, business).
- **VIII. Critical and Alternative Ethical Frameworks**: Choose this track if you are interested in perspectives that challenge or expand the traditional Western approaches (care ethics, feminism, existentialism).
- **IX. Interdisciplinary and Comparative Ethics**: Select this if you care about the connection between ethics and politics, technology/AI, or non-Western moral traditions.
